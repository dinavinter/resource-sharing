# resource-sharing

## personas:
### organizations - hospitals, volunteer centers, military bases, etc
### individuals

## joining the system:
register or dynamically created [according to forums, whatsapp groups, etc]
each persona has available resources and missing resources
each with quantity and possible location, time, category and other details
e.g. available 3 combat-vests in TLV
e.g. missing 20 volunteers in Beer Sheva tomorrow
with every added available resource -
the system tries to find a match of someone who is missing the same resource
and vise versa
when a match is found -
alert each party [via whatsapp-bot]
allow them to communicate directly
ask if they've set it - if so
allow each party to confirm resource-transaction
each approval comes with the actual quantity that was moved
updating the persona's available/missing accordingly
n-match scenario:
e.g. 2-match transaction
X has 3 vests in TLV and Y need 10 vests in Beer Sheva
Z has an available "transport" from TLV
match into 2-resource-transaction:
X->Z , Z->Y
